## The Big Picture

Since Release #1, we:
- Completed the professor portal with full menu functionality
- Added fiscal clearance management for admins
- Implemented automated schedule generation
- Enhanced course management with credits and professor assignments
- Built comprehensive test suites for system validation
- Improved user interface with welcome messages and visual elements

## What Actually Got Done

### 1. Professor Portal
Status: Complete 

The professor functionality that was missing in Release #1 is now fully operational. Professors can now:

**Professor Menu (5 options):**
1. View Assigned Courses - See all courses they're teaching with full details (CRN, course name, time, enrollment count)
2. See Enrolled Students - View the roster for any of their courses
3. Change Course Time - Update meeting times for their courses (saves to database)
4. Drop Student from Course - Remove students from their classes (with confirmation)
5. Exit - Log out

**Technical Implementation:**
- Professor class with ID, name, department, and assigned courses list
- professor_driver.py handles the menu and course interactions
- load_professor.py fetches professor data from the database
- Professors are properly routed through Driver.py (700 IDs)
- All changes save to course files in real-time

### 2. Admin Portal Enhancements
Status: Complete 

Admins gained two major new capabilities:

**Fiscal Clearance Management (New Option 7):**
- Admins can look up any student by their 900 number
- View current fiscal clearance status (Cleared/Not Cleared)
- Toggle clearance status with multi-step confirmation
- Changes save to Database/Accounts.txt
- Built-in safety: requires explicit confirmation before saving

**Automated Schedule Creation:**
- Admin can now auto-generate student schedules based on available courses
- System automatically selects courses up to 19 credit hours
- Shows generated schedule with total credits
- Admin can accept as-is or manually edit
- Option to add/remove courses interactively
- Automatically enrolls student in selected courses

The admin menu now has 7 options total (was 6 in Release #1).

### 3. Course Management System Upgrades
Status: Complete 

Significant enhancements to the Course class:

**Course Credits:**
- Every course now has a credit value (default: 3)
- Credits display when viewing course details
- Credits factor into schedule generation

**Professor Assignment:**
- New assign_professor() method assigns faculty to courses
- Stores professor name in Courses.csv
- Professor field appears when printing course details
- Shows "Not Assigned" if no professor has been set

**Display Improvements:**
- display_crn_desc() method lists all CRNs in descending order
- Course registry (courses_by_crn) enables class-level course lookups
- Better formatting for course information displays

**Technical Changes:**
- Course.py constructor now takes credits parameter
- Course files (Database/courses/*.txt) updated to include credits and professor fields
- All course saving/loading updated to handle new fields

### 4. Testing Infrastructure
Status: Complete 

Comprehensive test coverage was added across the system:

**Test Files Created:**
- test_student.py - Tests all Student class methods
- test_professor.py - Tests all Professor class methods  
- test_professor_driver.py - Tests professor menu functionality
- test_load_professor.py - Tests professor data loading
- test_course.py - Tests Course class methods including new features

All test files use Python's unittest framework. This significantly improves code reliability and makes future changes safer.

### 5. Database & File Structure Updates
Status: Complete 

**New Files:**
- Database/Attendance.csv - For professor attendance tracking (structure in place)
- Professor Files/ folder - Contains all professor-related code

**Updated Files:**
- Database/Courses.csv - Now includes credits and professor columns
- All course files in Database/courses/ - Updated format with new fields

**File Organization:**
- Student files consolidated into Student_files/ folder
- Professor files organized in Professor Files/ folder
- Test files placed in their respective feature folders

### 6. User Interface Improvements
Status: Complete 

Small but meaningful enhancements to user experience:

- Welcome messages added to admin_driver.py
- Introduction message added to student view info menu
- ASCII art pencil displays before major information
- ASCII art in Student.py prints correctly (line endings fixed)
- Clear screen function adjusted for better display (reduced from 50 to 3 newlines)

### 7. Bug Fixes & Code Quality
Status: Complete 

**Fixes Applied:**
- Line ending normalization (CRLF → LF) for cross-platform compatibility
- Course methods edited to ensure all tests pass
- Error handling improved in professor assignment
- Code organization improvements across multiple files

---

## What's Still Missing

Nothing major! All three user types (students, professors, admins) now have fully functional portals.

**Minor Gaps:**
- Attendance tracking infrastructure exists but isn't actively used yet
- Some edge cases in schedule creation could use refinement

## Bottom Line

Release #2 transforms the system from a two-portal foundation into a complete three-portal course management solution. The professor functionality gap from Release #1 is resolved, admins have powerful new tools for managing students and schedules, and the entire system is backed by comprehensive testing. All three user types can now perform their core functions end-to-end.
